## Installing Homebrew

Homebrew is the package manager for macOS. It allows you to install and manage software packages easily.

### Step 1: Install Homebrew

Open the Terminal and run the following command:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Step 2: Add Homebrew to your PATH

After installation, follow the on-screen instructions to add Homebrew to your PATH. The commands will look similar to the following (<YOUR_USERNAME> needs to be replaced):

```sh
(echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

```

Continue by creating a new `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
touch ~/.zshrc
```

A further substep involves adding the following line to your `~/.zshrc` by running:

```sh
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Reload your terminal with:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Installing Zsh and Oh My Zsh

Zsh is a powerful shell, and Oh My Zsh is a delightful open-source framework for managing your Zsh configuration.

### Step 1: Install Zsh (if not already installed)

macOS comes with Zsh pre-installed, but you can install it via Homebrew to ensure you have the latest version:

```sh
brew install zsh
```

### Step 2: Install Oh My Zsh

Install Oh My Zsh using the following command:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Step 3: Set Zsh as Default Shell

You can set Zsh as your default shell by running:

```sh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## Installing NVM (Node Version Manager)

NVM allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on your machine.

### Step 1: Install NVM via Homebrew

Run the following command to install NVM:

```sh
brew install nvm
```

### Step 2: Configure NVM

Create a directory for NVM and add it to your shell profile:

```sh
mkdir ~/.nvm
echo "export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Reload your terminal:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 3: Install Node.js

Now you can install the latest version of Node.js with:

```sh
nvm install node
```

You can also install specific versions with:

```sh
nvm install <version>
```

## Installing Browsers

As a frontend developer, having multiple browsers for testing is essential. You can install Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave via Homebrew.

### Step 1: Install Browsers

Run the following commands to install each browser:

```sh
brew install --cask google-chrome
brew install --cask firefox
brew install --cask microsoft-edge
brew install --cask brave-browser
```

## Setting Up Git

Git is a version control system that is widely used in development.

### Step 1: Install Git

Git comes pre-installed on macOS, but you can update it via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install git
```

### Step 2: Configure Git

Set up your global Git configuration:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Installing VS Code

Visual Studio Code is a popular code editor for frontend development.

### Step 1: Install VS Code

Install VS Code via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

### Step 2: Install VS Code Extensions

Some useful extensions for frontend development include:

- Prettier - Code formatter
- ESLint - Linting JavaScript
- Live Server - Launch a development local server with live reload feature
- GitLens - Git supercharged

You can install these directly within the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.

## Installing Additional Tools

Here are some additional tools that you might find useful:

### Step 1: Install Yarn (alternative package manager to npm)

```sh
brew install yarn
```

### Step 2: Install HTTP Server (for serving static files)

```sh
npm install -g http-server
```

### Step 3: Install Docker (for containerization)

```sh
brew install --cask docker
```

### Step 4: Install Postman (for API testing)

```sh
brew install --cask postman
```

## Further Steps

### Setting up SSH keys for Github

1. Generate a new SSH key (if you don't have one):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

When prompted, press Enter to accept the default file location. You can enter a passphrase for extra security or press Enter for no passphrase.

3. Start the SSH agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

4. Create or modify your SSH config file:

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

Add these lines to the config file:

```bash
Host github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

5. Add your SSH key to the agent:

```bash
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

6. Copy your public key:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

7. Add the key to GitHub:

   - Go to GitHub.com and sign in
   - Click your profile photo â†’ Settings
   - In the sidebar, click "SSH and GPG keys"
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Give your key a descriptive title
   - Paste your key into the "Key" field
   - Click "Add SSH key"

8. Test your connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message saying "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."

Now you can use SSH to interact with your GitHub repositories. When cloning new repos, use the SSH URL (git@github.com:username/repository.git) instead of HTTPS.

### Useful VSCode Extensions

Here the terminal commands to install the extensions individually:

```bash
code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
code --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode
code --install-extension bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
code --install-extension EditorConfig.EditorConfig
code --install-extension ms-playwright.playwright
```

You can also combine them into a single line using the following:

```bash
code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint && code --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode && code --install-extension bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss && code --install-extension EditorConfig.EditorConfig && code --install-extension ms-playwright.playwright
```

### Common Aliases (add to ~/.zshrc):

```bash
# Git aliases
alias gs='git status'
alias gp='git pull'
alias gc='git commit'
alias gch='git checkout'

# npm aliases
alias ni='npm install'
alias nrd='npm run dev'
alias nrb='npm run build'
alias nrs='npm run start'
```

### Finder Settings

Useful Finder default settings:

```bash

# Show hidden files
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES

# Show path bar in Finder
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowPathbar -bool true

# Set default Finder view to List view for all windows
defaults write com.apple.Finder FXPreferredViewStyle -string "Nlsv"

# Restart Finder to apply changes
killall Finder
```

### Programming Fonts

```bash
# Install useful coding fonts
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-fira-code
brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono
```

## Conclusion

With these tools installed, your macOS M\* machine is now ready for frontend development. Happy coding!
